## How to play

Once you are on the page, you can either press the start button to start the quiz, or click the view highscores button in the top left to view your previous highscores. Once you click start, a timer will start counting down from 75, and you have 75 seconds to complete the quiz. Chose from 1 of 4 buttons and it will tell you whether you guessed correctly or wrong as it displays the next question. If you answer wrong, 5 seconds will be taken off your time limit. Once you have completed all the questions or you have run out of time, it will ask you to enter your initials to save you highscore which is your total questions right, and the time you had left on your quiz. Then it will display your highscore on the board as well as any of your previous scores. Press restart button to play again.
